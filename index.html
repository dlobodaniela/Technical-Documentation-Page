            <article>
                <p>In simple terms, HTML represents the standard markup language for creating web pages online. It
                    stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and its most primary function is to establish the structure,
                    layout and presentation of individual landing pages. While web browsers do not directly display HTML
                    language, it plays a pivotal role in helping to create a visible, accessible and easy to use site.
                </p>
                <p>HTML is also underpinned by a number of individual elements, which gradually build web pages,
                    structure the presentation of content and bring your website to life. These elements are created and
                    contained within ‘tags’, which define alternate pieces of content such as headings, paragraphs, and
                    similar examples.

            <header>HTML Page Structure</header>
            <article>
                <p>Typically, a page will be made up of three structural elements:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Header:</span> The header contains content relevant to all pages on your
                        site, such as a logo or
                        website name, and a navigation system. The header is seen on each page.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Main Body:</span> This occupies the largest area on a web page. It
                        contains content specific to the
                        page being viewed.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Footer:</span> content usually includes contact information, a shipping
                        address or legal
                        notices. Like the header, the footer appears on every page, but it’s positioned at the bottom.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Here’s what those basic structural elements look like when they come together:</p>


                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        &lt;html&gt;<br><br>
                        &lt;head&gt; <br>
                        You can put text or code here, like a<br> 
                        Google Analytics tracking code for<br>
                        example. <br>
               
                        &lt;/head&gt;<br><br>
                        &lt;body&gt; <br>
                
                        The main body of your page goes<br>here. Fill it with text and images!<br>
               
                        &lt;/body&gt;<br><br>
                        &lt;/html&gt;

            <article>
                <p>The starting point for any HTML code is individual tags, which can be used to create all crucial
                    elements and help to structure your web pages. Below, we will take a look at the most common tags
                    before we explore how they can be leveraged to generate specific, on-page elements:</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Heading Tags</h3>
                <p>All online documents, including web pages, begin with a heading. These are constructed using HTML
                    tags, with the language currently allowing for up to six variably sized elements that also enable
                    you to structure your content with additional titles, subtitles and highlighted lines of bold text.
                    To start your heading, you simply prefix the relevant text with the &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;h2&gt; ,
                    &lt;h3&gt; , &lt;h4&gt; , &lt;h5&gt; or &lt;h6&gt; tag depending on the desired size.</p>
                <p>You must then apply a closing tag at the end of the heading to encapsulate the text, and will be
                    displayed as follows in HTML format:</p>

                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1&gt;This is heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h2&gt;This is heading 2&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h3&gt;This is heading 3&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h4&gt;This is heading 4&lt;/h4&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h5&gt;This is heading 5&lt;/h5&gt;<br>
                        &lt;h6&gt;This is heading 6&lt;/h6&gt;<br>
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>Once confirmed, this will translate into the following aesthetic on your website&rsquo;s landing
                    page:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <p style="font-size:36px;line-height:0.3;font-weight:bold">This is
                        heading 1</p>
                    <p style="font-size:30px;line-height:1.2;font-weight:bold">
                        This is heading 2</p>
                    <p style="font-size:25px;line-height:1.2;font-weight:bold">
                        This is heading 3</p>
                    <p style="font-size:20px;line-height:1.2;font-weight:bold">
                        This is heading 4</p>
                    <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4;font-weight:bold">
                        This is heading 5</p>
                    <p> <span style="font-size:12px;line-height:1.4;font-weight:bold">This
                            is heading 6</span>
                </div>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Paragraph Tags</h3>
                <p>A similar principle is applied to starting paragraph tags, which are depicted by &lt;p&gt;. This
                    allows you to structure your content and divide it into relevant paragraphs, which in turn
                    translates into an easier and more seamless reading experience. Once again, the &lt;p&gt; tag
                    should be placed at the beginning of the relevant text, before the alternate closing tag is
                    applied at the end to complete the effect. For example:</p>

                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;Your First Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Your Second Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Your Third Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>Outside of the HTML format, this will break the text down as follows on your finished web page:</p>

                <div class="code">
                    <p>Your First Paragraph</p>
                    <p>Your Second Paragraph</p>
                    <p>Your Third Paragraph</p>
                </div>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Line Break Tags</h3>
                <p>Line breaks creates a distinction at which lines of text are broken and continued on the following
                    line. There is a core difference between line breaks and paragraphs in the field of HTML, as while
                    the latter are standard block elements that contain text, the former creates a separation within an
                    existing &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
                <p>Because of this, line breaks represent an empty element in HTML and are therefore not defined by
                    either opening or closing tags. Instead, they are depicted by the &lt;br&gt; tag, which can be
                    inserted into existing &lt;p&gt; elements to break up text and potentially highlight important
                    pieces of information. Here is an example:</p>
                <p class="code"><code>&lt;p&gt;Good morning&lt;br&gt; Many thanks for your enquiry, we will contact you if we require anything else.&lt;br&gt; Best Regards&lt;br&gt; Mr. J ones&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code></p>
                <p>Once applied, this will break the text up as follows:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <p>Good morning, </p>
                    <p>Many thanks for your enquiry, we will contact you if we require anything else.</p>
                    <p>Best Regards</p>
                    <p> Mr. Jones
                    </p>
                </div>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Image Tags</h3>
                <p>Image tags also represent empty elements in HTML, which once again means that they do not feature a
                    closing tag. As they only contain attributes that relate to the URL of the image that you are
                    embedding onto the site, they are defined simply by the &lt;img&gt; tag at the beginning of the
                    element.
                    These can be placed anywhere on your website, although it is unusual to include them in existing
                    elements such as paragraphs or headings. Here is how a typical HTML image tag will present itself:
                </p>
                <p class="code"><code>&lt;img src="url" alt="some_text" style="width:width;height:height;"&gt;</code>
                </p>
                <p>You should also provide alternate text for your image, which helps people to view it in the case of
                    slow loading times or the use of screen reader. This way, if the browser cannot find an image, it
                    will display the value of the alternate attribute to viewers. This once again uses the image tag,
                    but includes a different set of attributes:</p>
                <p class="code">
                    <code>&lt;img src="wrongname.gif" alt ="HTML5 Icon" style="width: 128px; height: 128px;"&gt;</code>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

            <header>HTML Elements</header>
            <article>
                <p>While all aspects of the HTML language are represented by a tag, for example, a defined element that
                    includes content must have both a starting and a closing tag. So, headings and paragraphs are HTML
                    elements because they use starting and closing tags to encapsulate and augment the relevant text. In
                    contrast, empty elements either contain attributes or no content at all, allowing them to be used
                    within existing elements without the need for a closing tag.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Defining HTML Elements</h3>
                <p>When using examples such as headings and paragraphs, the correct application of starting and close
                    tags is crucial. It is the starting tag (such as &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;p&gt;) that defines the element
                    in question, for example, while the closing tag ensures that this element is not continued across
                    the remainder of the web page. If you fail to use the closing &lt;/p&gt;tag at the end of a desired
                    paragraph, for example, the text will appear in a single block that is unsightly and extremely
                    difficult to read.</p>
                <p>All closing tags are identical to starting tags apart from the fact that the former feature a forward
                    slash before the relevant characters. So in the instance of an &lt;h1&gt; heading, the closing tag
                    will be &lt;/h1&gt;, while for paragraphs you will always use &lt;/p&gt; to define the break in
                    text. This requires attention to detail while coding, and it is important to note when programming
                    headings that the number you use (such as h1 or h2) is applied in both the starting and the closing
                    tags.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Bold, Italic and Underlined Text in HTML</h3>
                <p>Let’s say that you want to highlight a word within an existing paragraph element. You can achieve
                    this by making it bold, using simple tags within the standard &lt;p&gt; element. Using HTML, you
                    will program this as follows:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;I want &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt; word to be bold.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                </div>
                <p>This instance it will produce the following results:</p>
                <p class="code">I want <b>this</b> word to be bold.</p>
                <p>Now, let’s say that you would also like to change the typography of this word so that it is also
                    italic, which should be coded like this:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;I want &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; word to be bold.&lt;/ p&gt;</code>
                </div>
                <p>As you can see, the starting and closing italic tags have simply been incorporated into the &lt;p&gt;
                    element. This will now transform the content within the element so that it appears as follows: </p>
                <p class="code">I want <i><b>this</b></i> word to be bold.</p>

                <p>Of course, you may decide that you would prefer to highlight this word in a different way, such as
                    underline (which is represented by the &lt;u&gt; and &lt;/u&gt; tags):</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;I want &lt;u&gt;this&lt;/u&gt; word to be underlined.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                </div>
                <p>In this instance, the text will appear as follows on your document or landing page:</p>
                <p>I want <u>this</u> word to be underlined.</p>

                <p>If tags are the building blocks that construct and define elements, then HTML attributes can be used
                    to customise their characteristics (such as style, colour and language. All HTML elements have core
                    attributes, which provide core information and are always specified within the stat tag. They tend
                    to come in pairs, so will often appear in the following format: name=”value.“</p>
                <p>In simple terms, the name represents the property that you want to set, while the value relates to
                    the specific criteria that you want to incorporate.</code></p>
                <p>There are a large number of attributes that can be applied to your HTML elements, but those that are
                    most relevant to fledgling webmasters are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ‘Align’ Attribute</li>
                    <li>The ‘Href’ Attribute</li>
                    <li>The ‘Color’ Attribute</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>The ‘Align’ Attribute</h3>
                <p>We have already touched on the format of HTML attributes (name=”value), and the best embodiment of
                    this occurs when you try to align the content within your elements. You may decide to center all
                    paragraphs on a specific page, for example, with the alignment being the property that you wish to
                    set. Subsequently, ’center’ is the value of the attribute, although you have the choice of aligning
                    your text to the left or the right. For example:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&lt;p align="center" &gt;This text is center aligned&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                </div>
                <p>This will align your &lt;p&gt; elements in the centre of the page, and create a uniform layout to
                    suit the specific nature of your website (see below):</p>
                <div style="text-align: center !important; line-height: 2" class="code">
                    <p>This text is center aligned</p>
                    <p>This text is center aligned</p>
                    <p>This text is center aligned</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The ‘Href’ Attribute</h3>
                <p>If you are going to build a visible website, it is important that you incorporate both inbound and
                    outbound links. HTML links are defined with the &lt;a&gt; tag, which includes the destination link
                    along with the affiliated anchor text that will house the URL. It is the ‘href ’ attribute that
                    specifies the site address, however, this is incorporated as part of the start tag. It is coded in
                    HTML as follows:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                </div>
                <p>This clearly highlights the distinction between the starting and the closing tag, and will translate
                    as follows on your landing page:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>
                </div>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>The ‘Color’ Attribute</h3>
                <p>This is another important attribute, as the use of colour can breathe life into your website while
                    helping to create important contrasts and a strong design aesthetic. In HTML, a colour can be
                    specified by using its name, although it is also possible to utilise an RGB or a HEX value to
                    achieve this aim.</p>
                <p>This is a style attribute, with your choice of color representing the value that you would like to
                    set. When applying the color red to a main heading, for example, it will look like this:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&lt;h1 style=”background-color:red”&gt;Background-color set by using red&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
                </div>
                <p>Once applied, this element will appear as follows on your website:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <h1 style="background-color:red">Background-color set by using red</h1>
                </div>
